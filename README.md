# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), implemented using **React** and **JavaScript**.

I used this project to practice and learn JavaScript and React. I focused on functional programming and modern JavaScript features.

## Project Structure

- The components used to build the UI are in the `components` folder ([./src/Components](./src/Components)).
- Each day's solution is implemented in a separate JavaScript file in [./src/Script](./src/Script/).
- The project is managed with **NPM**.
